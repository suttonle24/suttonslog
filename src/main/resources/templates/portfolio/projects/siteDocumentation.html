		There were two SharePoint-based projects at <a href="http://smith.co/" target="_blank">SMITH Co.</a> that I was tasked with creating maintenance documentation for in 2013... in addition to doing the development on. The first was for the Xerox Reseller Portal site, and because word spread around the office of my apparent documentation-writing prowess, I was tapped to create a second document for the Hawaii Department of Education's (HIDOE) public-facing site. I initially volunteered to create the documentation to give my eyes a momentary break from the code and because I've always enjoyed writing and teaching people, even though my primary role at SMITH was to do front-end development work.

Amounting to 30+ and 50+ page documents, respectively, creating the site documentation for Xerox and HIDOE was no small feat. The HIDOE document alone took over 60 hours to complete. What was challenging in creating these was coming up with and managing a hierarchical structure that worked for the various complexities of step-by-step instructions for different tasks. Each document also included a table of contents with hot links that went straight to the different sections of the document... a handy feature when trying to navigate 50+ pages of instructions. I must admit, though, that my proudest moment during the creation of these documents was when I ran the lengthy HIDOE document by one of SMITH's copy editors and it came back with very few edits. I wasn't really expecting that after having not written anything of length since my last college term paper. All in all, these two projects were a good showcase to SMITH, explaining to them that I can write solid documentation in addition to writing solid code.
